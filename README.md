# Hi, I'm Andrés Bedoya 👋

I hold a B.Sc. in Systems and Informatics Engineering, and I'm a seasoned JavaScript developer with over 12 years of experience. My passion lies in the intersection of technology and creativity, particularly in web development and the world of Open Source.

Beyond code, I am deeply interested in fund investing and personal finance, finding the perfect balance between financial strategy and technological innovation. My journey into the tech realm began at an early age, where I embraced blogging and explored the vast opportunities the internet offers (25 years ago).

As an Internet enthusiast, I leverage communication, music, networks, and social interactions through technology to enhance daily life. I am a firm believer in the power of the free culture, advocating for an open and collaborative approach to knowledge and innovation.
